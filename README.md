# Collatz
Starting playing around with C#, so I decided to throw together a quick program to test the Collatz Conjecture.

===USE===================================================================================

To use the program, just compile it, then call it from the command line as "Collatz x", where x = any integer between -2,147,483,648 and 2,147,483,647. The program will run until the starting number reaches 1, at which point it will tell you how many iterations it took to get to 1.
